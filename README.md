i like harry potter movies and the show ghost adventures
Post Malone is my secret celebrity crush even though I think he looks like a trashcan. I affectionally refer to him as "Posty" in all conversations that he comes up in. One of the best episodes of Ghost Adventures has Posty as a guest investigator and it was awesome.
I taught myself to code in 1999. I went to ITT for a degree and they closed 1 semester before I was supposed to graduate. I needed 3 credit hours; 1 course there is 4.50 credit hours. 
I have never been able to land and keep a consistently paying job. 
I have continued to teach myself code---really ramping up on expanding my programming and coding languages. 
Right now I know the following languages: HTML, HTML5, CSS, SASS, Python, SQL, and JavaScript--even though it is incredibly difficult for me to understand for some reason. I also know the basics of Bootstrap.
There are several langugaes in my "queue" such as Less, Ajax, Bootstrap 3-5, R, React, etc.
